        <h1>Professional Website Post Mortem</h1>
        <h2>12/05/2025</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This entire project originally began as a project for my Web Tech
          Class as a task to create a "Responsive Website" based on a magazine
          article. (You can see the original site
          <a href="https://people.rit.edu/sb5175/235/project1/">here</a>) I was
          really proud of what the site looked like but I was a little scared of
          how complex the site would balloon to with how long just the main home
          page took. Thankfully I was able to copy and paste a lot of the basic
          html (like the header and the nav bar) along with moving a bunch of
          the global <strong>CSS</strong> to a separate page which made the new
          pages much quicker to make.
        </p>

        <h3>What Went Well</h3>
        <p>
          I was really happy with how the color pallete came out. I was initally
          went with a color pallete more in line with the original article but
          once I was free to modify the page to my own choices I decided to make
          some changes and add a splash of contrast with the pastel green. I was
          really focused on choosing soft colors that won't strain the eyes and
          look out of place and I think I ended up with some nice colors
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also quite proud of the little
          <strong>Javascript</strong> function that I made for this site. It
          wasn't anything particularly complicated but it essentially let me
          convert any <strong>HTML</strong> element that I wanted into a button
          that led to a separate page. This was mostly used to turn banners for
          projects into a button to open the respective project info page. This
          was an interesting way to utilize <strong>Javascript</strong> to make
          smaller functions that would've been a headache to implement with base
          <strong>HTML</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>What Could Have Gone Better</h3>
        <p>
          I really don't think that I implemented some of the repeated elements
          correctly. Elements like the Header and the Nav Bar are just copied
          and pasted over and over again into each separate HTML page which
          makes it a pain to update. Thankfully I was able to separate the
          generic
          <strong>CSS</strong> into it's own file which made it much easier to
          reuse but the only way I saw online to do the same with
          <strong>HTML</strong> is to use PHP which I don't know yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also still a newcomer to the web development space. Thankfully
          this project didn't require a large amount of
          <strong>Javascript</strong> but I definitely know that there was
          plenty of cool <strong>CSS</strong> tricks that would have been nice
          to have that I simply didn't know about or know well enough to
          implement. I would have liked to have a nicer mobile layout that was a
          little bit more responsive but I imagine that this website will
          largely be viewed on a PC window instead of a mobile phone, so it
          isn't a large priority right now.
        </p>
        <h3>TLDR</h3>
        <p>
          I'm very happy with how the portfolio page came out. I really like the
          colors that I chose and the overall layout. I'll keep adding more
          projects and games as they come but this serves as a good starting
          point. That said, I'm still a newbie at web development and the page
          still has a lot of room to grow. I plan to continue adding to this
          site as I grow as a developer and learn new techniques and tools!
