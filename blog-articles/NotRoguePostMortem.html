        <h2>12/14/2025</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This project was made as the final of 3 projects for my Web Design
          class at RIT, IGME 235: Intro to Game Web Tech. We learned about the 3
          big components of front end web design, that being
          <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and lastly
          <strong>Javascript</strong>. Now, with this being the last project of
          the semester, and of the class, it was designed to test all of the
          concepts that we had learned, but mostly to test our Javascript
          knowledge. We were originally given access to the
          <strong>Javascript</strong> graphics rendering API PixiJS, but I ended
          up wanting to use just the basic DOM elements to make a game. I
          remembered the game Universal Paperclips and liking it's minimalist
          design, so I chose to focus on a more text based game to emulate that
          style. I ended up making a text based roguelike, which let me focus
          more on the programming and less on visual design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Safe to say I learned a <strong>lot</strong> about not only
          <strong>Javascript</strong>, but about larger software design
          principles that I could apply to other projects that come in the
          future. That isn't to say that it was all smooth sailing, I also
          learned a lot of hard lessons about scope and what I could achieve
          with the relatively little time that I had to make the project.
        </p>

        <h3>What Went Well</h3>

        <h4>The Dungeon Generation</h4>
        <p>
          I'm extremely proud of what I was able to teach myself with regards to
          a lot of the backend and, sadly, a lot of what the player doesn't get
          to see. One of the hardest parts was the procedurally generated
          dungeon. I had never made any procedural generation systems by myself
          before, I had followed some tutorials for a GameMaker studio algorithm
          as well as one or two for Unity a long time ago but neither helped me
          in this situation. After a lot of googling and scrolling many forum
          threads, what ended up helping me the most was actually pulling out my
          pocket notebook and physically writing out what I thought the steps
          needed to be in the process itself. This process, similar to the
          rubber ducky method for debugging, let me formalize what the steps
          would need to be and remove the vagueness from the process. This also
          helped immensely by giving me a clear path forward and obvious things
          to implement. This was by no means an easy process (as you can see in
          the picture, I almost gave up after a long night of little progress)
          and I spent a lot of time working on making the feature functional.
          Thankfully I getting the process to work and I was extremely proud of
          myself for not giving up.

        <h4>The Combat System</h4>
        <p>
          I am also happy with how the combat system turned out. This was also a
          new one for me, since I had never made a turn based combat system
          before, and especially not in the event based update system of a
          website. The inital system wasn't <em>too</em> hard, with a similar
          process to the dungeon generation I was able to quickly sort out the
          steps each turn would need to take and within a few days I had the
          basic system working. My only issue was that everything happened
          instantly, the player would input an action and in the blink of an
          eye, thanks to the computer's speed, all of the AI's actions would
          fill up the combat log. This wasn't a particularly game breaking
          issue, but I knew that the player experience would greatly suffer if I
          left it as it was so I set about solving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first thought was a timer of some kind, where the log would display
          each message for a set amount of time and then do the next action. I
          then came to the issue of how <strong>Javascript</strong> actually
          operates. I was used to systems that had a constant update loop so
          that I could just use that to count up a set amount of time but in
          <strong>Javascript</strong>, at least to my knowledge, that kind of
          system isn't possible without external libraries. Thankfully, in
          hindsight, this wouldn'tve been a very good implementation since it
          still takes the control of the reading speed out of the player's hands
          and it would be impossible to find an amount of time that worked
          perfectly for everyone. I ended up going with just pressing the space
          bar to continue which presented it's own host of issues with commands
          that were more than one word but I think I was able to at least get
          the system functional by the time I was done.
        </p>

        <h3>What Could Have Gone Better</h3>
        <h4>Javascript is not a Game Making Engine</h4>
        <p>
          To the surprise of absoutely nobody, I had a <em>very</em> difficult
          time working with <strong>Javascript</strong> as a game making tool.
          Obviously base <strong>JS</strong> is not a particularly suited
          language to coding games and I found that out very quickly. While I
          liked not having to worry about scope when referencing fields, the
          lack of variable typing and general vagueness of the entire language
          was a massive headache to deal with. Many of the bugs that I
          encountered during development were due to type incompatability and
          just passing in the wrong value. This was just never something that I
          had to deal with when I was using something like
          <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong> and took a lot of
          getting used to. Whilst this was definitely a good learning experience
          and I gained a lot of new knowledge on how to structure code, I don't
          think I will be reaching for <strong>Javascript</strong> for something
          like a game jam or personal project any time soon.
        </p>
        <h4>Overscoping strikes again!</h4>
        <p>
          For a little bit of perspective, I spent a little over 3 weeks on this
          project. The first week I spent during my Thanksgiving break which,
          alongside enjoying being back home with my family, I also spent a lot
          of time working on this website. The second week was back in college
          where I also spent a lot of time preparing for my other exams and
          finals for other classes. Lastly, the final week was during my final
          exams, where I had other projects and exams to do and couldn't
          dedicate a lot of time to NotRogue. Safe to say that I had a lot on my
          plate. With all of that in mind I'm proud of the amount of content
          that I was able to fit into this game and still get it to a reasonably
          functional state. That said, looking back I can see there were
          definitely components that were either unnecessary or I should have
          cut in order to focus on other things. Chiefly I think that I should
          have chosen to either focus on the procedural generation or the RPG
          system. Having both systems makes for a much more fun game but I don't
          think that I was able to give either system enough attention to get it
          to a state that I'm particularly happy with. Having chosen to have a
          pregenerated map or making a procedural dungeon visualizer would have
          let me make those systems with as much polish as possible and have had
          prevented the need for as much crunch as I ended up needing to finish
          the game.
        </p>
        <h3>TLDR</h3>
        <p>
          I learned a ton about <strong>Javascript</strong> and basic game
          programming throughout this project. The dungeon generation and combat
          systems were two systems that proved to be extremely challenging but
          also extremely fulfilling to figure out and implement. Aside from
          learning how to implement the two systems, I also found a new method
          of breaking down complex problems that works for me that I plan to use
          for future projects. That said, I have learned that
          <strong>Javascript</strong> is not a particularly easy language to
          program a game in and I should have taken the fact that I was learning
          a new language alongside making the project when I was planning the
          scope of the game since I overscoped a little bit and should've spent
          more time polishing a smaller amount of mechanics.
