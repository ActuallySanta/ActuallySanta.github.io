                Don't Lose Your Head is a puzzle platformer made in a week for
                the 2025 Scream Jam. Play as a skeleton collecting as they
                navigate a haunted manor utilizing the fact that they can throw
                their head to activate conveniently placed levers and buttons to
                collect candy for their friends!

                I personally worked as the project lead and one of the main
                programmers. I also had to step in and do some of the
                environmental art due to some restructuring during the jam
                itself.

                Overall I learned a lot about what it takes to work with a team
                and how to lead one, I learned that consistent meetings and
                attention to the overall progress make it easy to catch issues
                before they snowball into something unmanageable. I also learned
                how to scope a project to the amount of time that we had and
                what to prioritize to make sure we have a complete experience
                before beginning to polish

                Forced to fulfill a never-ending quota forced upon you by your
                late father's debtors (you should really have your lawyers look
                into that I don't think it's legal), you descend into the
                magical dungeon filled with foul monsters but also valuable
                gold.

                While you're down there you may encounter a mysterious shop run
                by a shadowy figure that may sell you items and abilities in
                exchange for some of the loot that you've collected so far...

                I worked as the project lead as well as the main artist for the
                majority of this project, along with contributing a lot of the
                code for the baseline systems and the shop system present in the
                game.

                This was my first attempt at being the lead for a project, and
                while I'm proud of what I was able to complete I definitely know
                that I had room to grow after this experience. For starters, I
                didn't make the decision to take lead until a large portion of
                our time had already been used up. This left me with less time
                to make the project and I would've been able to make a much
                better project if I had been able to better utilize the time
                given. Second I had never lead meetings like this before so
                early on I struggled to focus on the important parts of the
                meeting that needed the most amount of attention, which
                primarily was delegating tasks and planning for the coming
                sprint.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the end we delivered a project that I was proud of but I
                definitely have more to learn. I'm happy that I was able to
                learn about what it takes to lead a project like this and this
                was a strong first forey into the topic itself.
